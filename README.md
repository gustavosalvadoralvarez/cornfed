CORNFED
=======

The story of a user's journey through a webpage is like a long sentence, where each word 
is a vector of values associated with a browser event, plus a timestamp (to make a timeseries). 
Cornfed allows you to record portions of that sentence efficiently, 
and dispatch them to an html5 Worker to do with as you will.
